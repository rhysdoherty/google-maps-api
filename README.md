# google-maps-api
 
This project contains my interpertation of the Google Interview Challange _(option 2)_. The objective:

* Create a webpage that uses Google Maps API to show a map centered on user location
* Draw a transparent circle on the map, whose center is also the userâ€™s current location
* Allow the user to switch between a radius of 500m, 1000m, or 2000m for the circle
* Allow the user to show/hide traffic information
